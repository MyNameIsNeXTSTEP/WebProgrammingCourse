<u>Characteristics of a network.</u>

A **network** is the name given to two or more computers connected together with the ability to transmit data between each other.
There are two main types of networks:
- Local area networks (LAN) - is the name given to a network which is spread over a small geographical area or a single site, for example: a school.
- Wide area networks (WAN) - is the name given to a network which is spread over a large geographical area.

Large corporations with offices in multiple locations will often have a WAN allowing them to communicate between different sites.

<u>Protocols</u>

A protocol is a **set of rules** defining how two and more computers **communicate** with each other. Protocols are standard so that all devices have a designated method of communicating with each other, regardless of manufacturer.
Examples of commonly used protocols are:
- **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) – Used for web page rendering, an encrypted version, **HTTPS** (Secure), is becoming more common
- **TCP/IP** (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol) – This is a networking protocol used in the routing of packets through networks
- **POP3** (Post Office Protocol) and **IMAP** (Internet Message Access Protocol) – Mailing protocols, used for email access.
- **FTP** (File Transfer Protocol) – Used for the transmission of files over networks.
