<u>Firewalls</u>
A **firewall** is a device designed to prevent unauthorised access to a network. A firewall consists of two network interface cards (NICs) between the user and the Internet. The firewall passes the packets between these two NICs and compares them against a set of rules set by the firewall software. The preconfigured rules are called **packet filters**.

Packet filtering / static filtering **limits network access** in accordance with administrator rules and policies. It works by examining the source IP, destination IP and the protocols being used as well as the ports being requested.

When access is denied by a firewall, two things can occur. The packet can either be dropped or rejected. A rejected packet sends an alert to the sender to notify them of the error whereas a dropped packet will not.

<u>Proxies</u>
A proxy server acts as an intermediary, collecting and sending data on behalf of the user. There are several benefits of using proxies:
- The privacy of the user is protected and they remain anonymous
- The proxy server can cache frequently used website data making it faster to load
- Proxies can reduce overall web traffic
- Can be used by administrators to prevent access to sensitive or irrelevant information at work or at school
 
<u>Encryption</u>
Encryption is a way of keeping data secure when transmitting it over the Internet. Encryption makes data unreadable if it is intercepted. Data is encrypted and decrypted using a set of keys.
